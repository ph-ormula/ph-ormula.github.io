# Sum-Angle Formula from Vectors: Intermediate Trigonometry and 2-Dimensional Vectors

## Basic Trigonometry: Overview

- Unit circle
- Radian
- Angle between $0$ and $2\pi$ corresponds to a point on unit circle
- Sine: signed height of the point
- Cosine: signed position of "shadow" of the point

## 2-Dimensional Vectors: Described Numerically
