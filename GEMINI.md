- When writing math equations, surround them with 2 `$`s on both sides instead of 1 to render them correctly
- Always indent properly using tabs, use spaces only if the language doesn't support tab indentation (e.g. python), and in that case use 4 spaces
- If the user says some scripts get displayed directly as text on the website, and indentation might be the cause, try to remove all indentations on that script and see if it works. If the reason is found not to be indentation, restore it to indent properly with tabs
